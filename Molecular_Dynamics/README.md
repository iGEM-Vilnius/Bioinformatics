# Molecular Dynamics Running Script

This directory contains molecular dynamics bundle with .mdp files and Perl scripts that can 
be used for molecular dynamics simulations.

## Prerequisites
Download and install [Perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html).
Install [GROMACS](https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/install-guide/index.html).

## copy_dir.pl
A script that copies the directory that has required .mdp files and Perl scripts for molecular 
dynamics simulations.

### Usage
`perl copy_dir.pl [path_to_new_directory]`

## generate_system_gro.pl
A script that runs needed GROMACS commands to get the number of atoms in the gro system.
The system is the one that has a protein solvated in the solution determined by ions.mdp file.
`perl generate_system_gro.pl [path_to_protein_file]`

## protein_md.pl
A script that runs needed GROMACS molecular dynamics of the protein.
`perl protein_md.pl [path_to_protein_file]`

## clean.pl
A script that cleans the working directory from all files that were generated by GROMACS MD workflow.
`perl clean.pl`
